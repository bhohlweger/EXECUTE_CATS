TO COMPILE THIS EXAMPLE:

1) CATS must be installed
3) Copy this folder away from your GitHub folder for convinience.
4) Open CMakeLists.txt and change all highlighed paths.
5) run in terminal: source configure.sh
6) unless there are errors, run in terminal: make

7) In case you need to add more files to your program, add them in the add_executable function in CMakeLists.txt
